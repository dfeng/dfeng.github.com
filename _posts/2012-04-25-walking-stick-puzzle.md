This is an entirely pointless puzzle that I came up with during my stay at my grandparents house in China:

> You are in a room that only has a walking stick. This walking stick is your average upside down 'J' business. The object is to spin this walking stick as fast as possible. How?

Granted, this is more of a physical peculiarity than a logic puzzle.

Pointless Solution
==================
Instead of trying to spin it manually - like when you're lighting a fire with sticks - you should rest your hand on the top of the stick, and wobble your hand in such a fashion as to let the stick rotate itself. Once you speed this up, you can reach much faster speeds. See, I told you it was retarded.
