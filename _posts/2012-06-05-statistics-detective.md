Recently, I read the following [blogpost](http://sellthenews.tumblr.com/post/21067996377/noitdoesnot) on the statistical failures apparent in the (now infamous) paper expousing the 'Twitter Hedge Fund'. I thought it would be wise, considering my hiatus from statistical thinking for the past few months, to follow the writer's line of rationality, and see if I can come to the same conclusions. On a more general note, I think I will soon be flooding this arena with my own scribbles of the myriad things I read on the interweb.
