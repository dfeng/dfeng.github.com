  <h1>I am Derek Feng.</h1>
  <h3>I am a 1<sup>st</sup> Year Statistics Ph.D Student at Yale.</h3>
  <p>I'm interested in Theoretical Statistics, Bioinformatics, Econometrics, Machine Learning, Data Mining.</p>
  <p>I love playing badminton and football (soccer). I love singing.</p>
  <h3>I love Community (TV).</h3>
  <p>I am illusive. I am an devoted churchgoing atheist. I am a secular humanist, a rationalist. But I detest labels. Call me <em>Bob</em>. Or curious.</p>
  <h3>These people are funny: Stephen Fry, Bill Bailey, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, David Mitchell.</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Asking Gauss whether or not a statement is true or false constitutes a rigorous proof.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The empty set is defined as the set of theorems Gauss can't prove.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>All theorems were once called "The Gauss Theorem", however Gauss allowed others to take credit so it wouldn't confuse everyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are young men and women up and down the land who happily tell anyone who will listen that they don't have an academic turn of mind, or that they aren't lucky enough to have been blessed with a good memory, and yet can recite hundreds of pop lyrics and reel off any amount of information about footballers, cars and celebrities. Why? Because they are interested in those things. They are curious. If you are hungry for food you are prepared to hunt high and low for it. If you are hungry for information it is the same. Information is all around us, now more than ever before in human history. You barely have to stir or incommode yourself to find things out. The only reason people do not know much is because they do not care to know. They are incurious. Incuriousity is the oddest and most fooling failing there is.</p>
