For the past year, I've been wielding a handicapped Canon EOS 30D. Every time I give someone else the camera (which is rarely), they frame the shot, and press down. They press harder. Nothing. Usually the third time, with the force of a thousand trucks focused on their index finger, do they manage to take the shot. And if they're taking in portrait mode, forget it. The shutter button had collapsed under the pressures of abandonment.

I realised it was time to go full frame - and with the 5D Mark II heavily discounted, it was a no-brainer. As a gift to myself, I decided to go all the way, and got a Canon 35mm L f/1.4 prime lens. I've only dabbled for a day with it, but it seems to be shooting beautifully. I couldn't be happier with the upgrade.
