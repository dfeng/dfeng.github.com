The mind is a hard master to please. Why is it that a perfect design one day becomes the next day's dog food? Is it (structured) [procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/)? Is it because our mental algorithms for valuing design are inherently flawed, in that they sometimes converge to local maxima and not necessarily the global maximum?
