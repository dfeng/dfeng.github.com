The mind is a hard master to please. Why is it that after a few months (or even a few days), what I had considered to be the zenith of my creativity, ends up reminding me of a kindergarten's lunch box? This is now my third iteration of my blog, and I have yet to publicize it. Is this a case of the illusive goal of perfection that cannot ever be attained - striving to find the global maximum, where there isn't one to start with? Or is it saying something about how our mental algorithms value aesthetics, and how they change over time and with repetition? I for one am guilty of loving a particular song so much that I listen to it too often that it eventually loses its original appeal. This is probably that. Perhaps I should forbid myself to look at my own website, and simply work on the code and content. Right now, I probably make roughly 100 impressions on my own page a week - whenever I get bored, I like to look at this website and tweak things around. This is procrastination at its finest.
