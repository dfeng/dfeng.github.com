During my month long holiday in China, I was fortunate enough to be able to visit Yellow Mountain, which is located in AnHui Province. Whenever you think of any piece of Chinese artwork that contains mountains, they will inevitably be that of the Yellow Mountain. It possesses a unique beauty not found anywhere else on the planet.
